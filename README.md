Stock market prediction:
The Stock Market Prediction Model is a machine learning model that predicts the stock price for the next day based on historical stock data. This model uses LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory), to forecast future stock prices.

Predicts Next-Day Stock Price: The model predicts the next day's stock price based on the past 60 days of data.
Uses LSTM: A Long Short-Term Memory model is employed to capture time-series dependencies and trends in the stock price data.
Uses Yahoo Finance for Stock Data: Historical stock data is fetched using the yfinance library.
Preprocessing: The stock data is normalized using the MinMaxScaler to scale the features between 0 and 1 for optimal model performance.
